# BloggingAboutMyLife
This project uses Java/ JSP and SQL Server
This is a website built by me based on the requirements and design from an exercise in my Lab Java Web at FPT University.
With concise and constructive review and best practices from Mr TuanVM - Thank you!

This web is backed by a database with small data generated by me.
To run this, you need to run the SQL File called script.sql (Using SQL Server Management Studio). 
Note 1: You need to write: CREATE DATABASE BloggingDB because I use the generated database tool and it doesn't create the database by itself.
Note 2: Change username and password according to your SSMS account in the context.xml file if you encounter login error.

Then clone into your local directory and use Netbeans to run as a normal Java Web Project.
Have fun ^^
