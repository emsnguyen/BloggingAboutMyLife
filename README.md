# BloggingAboutMyLife
This project uses Java/ JSP and SQL Server
This is a website built by me based on the requirements and design from an exercise in my Lab Java Web at FPT University.
With concise and constructive review from Mr TuanVM - Thank you!

This web is backed by a database with small data generated by me.
To run this, you need to run the SQL File called script.sql (Using SQL Server Management Studio). You need to write: CREATE DATABASE BloggingDB because I use the generated database tool and it doesn't create the database by itself.
Then clone into your local directory and use Netbeans to run as a normal Java Web Project.
Have fun ^^
